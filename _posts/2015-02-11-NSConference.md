I am very lucky to have received a scholarship to attend [NSConference 7](http://nsconference.com), taking place in Leicester next month. I must admit I find it fairly bizarre that so many prominent Mac and iOS developers are descending on my hometown from all over the globe, but I am very much looking forward to meeting them and others in the community.
