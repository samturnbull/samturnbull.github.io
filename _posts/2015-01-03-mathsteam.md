I decided to submit my first app to the App Store today; a small app that only took an evening to put together. It is a two player game that involves shouting and anwering each other's simple maths questions, working together to try and reach the next level. It is inspired by the game [Spaceteam](http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/), and it was a fun small project to practise using Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework. It needs a lot of work to improve the UI, but I won't have much time to work on it due to exams, so I decided to submit it in its current state and update the UI later on. The app is called MathsTeam and will hopefully be live on the App Store once it is approved.  
  
  *Update 12th Jan 2015:* MathsTeam is now available on the [App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=955252556&mt=8)
