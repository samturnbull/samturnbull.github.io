Swift took us all by surprise at this year's WWDC, including many of Apple's employees. A successor to Objective C had been [discussed](http://arstechnica.com/staff/2005/09/1372/) for almost a decade, yet people still expressed dissapointment that what Apple revealed was not the Objective C 3.0 that they had [hoped](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/10/14/hypothetical-objective-c-3-0/) for, but something altogether more [ambitious](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/21/#swift).

At the point of the announement I had been teaching myself iOS development with Objective C for almost 6 months, so I was a bit hesitant to switch to Swift as I felt I was throwing away all that hard work. In reality of course there is a lot more to development than just the language, but switching to Swift would require more than just learning a new syntax.

Still, I was excited to try Swift and immediately began trying Xcode's playgrounds, and reading everything I could about it. I followed the development of the language with interest, but it was clear with each Xcode beta release that the large [changes](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=3) to the language, and no guarantees of source compatibilty, would make it difficult for a beginner developer to keep up.

So I decided to stick with the original plan of programming my project in Objective C. The language was not going to change, all of the great resources I had been learning from were written in Objective C, as were all of Apple's APIs. If I want to introduce some Swift later on, I can quite easily as Apple makes it [simple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html) to combine both languages in a single project.
