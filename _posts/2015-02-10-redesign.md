I created this website last year using [Camel](https://github.com/cliss/camel), which was good for what I needed at the time, but yesterday I chose to look for a more flexible blogging engine. I ended up going with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
