title: MathsTeam 1.0.1
---

MathsTeam 1.0.1 is now live on the App Store, which fixes a bug where the game would end for one player whilst the other continued playing . A local primary school wanted to play MathsTeam with their pupils, so 1.0.1 includes iOS 7 support and a toggle for a mode with simpler multiplications. The update was live on the App Store just a few hours after I submitted the build, which surprised me as I was expecting a wait of at least a week.
