###MathsTeam

Inspired by Spaceteam, this is a two player game that involves shouting out simple maths questions to your teammate, whilst tapping the correct answer to the questions that they shout to you. The game requires two iOS devices, with WiFi or Bluetooth turned on, as they connect using peer to peer technology.
